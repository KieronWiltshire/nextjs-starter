# Enterprise Next.js Frontend Starter

## Description

This is an enterprise-grade Next.js frontend application that provides a modern, responsive, and maintainable user interface. Built with TypeScript and following React best practices, it implements a robust authentication system, internationalization support, and real-time features using WebSocket integration.

This frontend application is designed to work in conjunction with the [NestJS Starter](https://github.com/KieronWiltshire/nestjs-starter) backend repository, which provides the necessary API endpoints and real-time functionality. It is recommended to use the NestJS Starter as the backend for this application.

- Follow Tailwind CSS best practices
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Follow the design system guidelines

### Adding New Features

When adding new features, follow these steps:

1. Create necessary components in the `src/components` directory
2. Add types in the `src/types` directory
3. Implement validation schemas in the `src/schema` directory
4. Add server actions in the `src/actions` directory
5. Create pages in the `src/app` directory
